# Gaussian-Mixture-Model-GMM--Python-Implementation
Implementation of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) in Python with visualization. Includes clustering, probability density estimation, and results from sample datasets.
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** for clustering and density estimation. It demonstrates the use of probabilistic models to fit data and visualize results effectively.

## Features
- Implementation of GMM from scratch and/or using scikit-learn
- Visualization of clusters and probability density
- Example on synthetic/sample datasets
- Useful for unsupervised learning and density estimation tasks

## File Structure
- GMM.ipynb â†’ Main notebook with GMM implementation and visualizations

##  Requirements
Install dependencies using: 
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
